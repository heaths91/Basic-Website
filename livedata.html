            The map above was made using Google API using KML data display live earthquake data. The map itself was not very difficult to make, but much more difficult to customize. Making the info boxes, size of map, and coordinates was easy, but customizing the symbology and legend was incredibly difficult. The symbology shows each quake as the same size, but it is only when clicking on an instance does the actual data become clear. As a developer the map was easy to create but difficult to manipulate, as a user it produces an output that is very easy to misinterpret.
