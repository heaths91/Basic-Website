            The map above was made using Google API using KML data to display live earthquake data from USGS over the past 30 days. The map itself was not very difficult to make, but much more difficult to customize. Making the info boxes, size of map, and coordinates was easy, but customizing the symbology and legend was incredibly difficult. The symbology shows each quake as the same size, but it is only when clicking on an instance does the actual data become clear. As a developer the map was easy to create but difficult to manipulate, as a user it produces an output that is very easy to misinterpret.

            The map above was made using Google API using a GeoJson format to display live earthquake data from USGS over the past week. I found this mashup easier to fiddle with, and the output to be more visually satisfying. From a developers standpoint I think that this mashup has more freedom for customization, and from an user's perspective I find this map easy to use, the only drawback being that there is less information provided with the simple mouseover technique.

            The map above was made using ESRI API using KML data to display live earthquake data over the past week. This mashup was my least favorite, I tried (unsuccessfully) to add a legend to aid the user in understanding and navigating the map. I found the output to be visually appealling and from a developer's perspective, the ESRI API help forums do offer a ton of help. But as someone with limited programming knowledge it is difficult to just pull out portions of code and make them functioning map elements. From an end user's perspective the map output is visually appealling and the info box that appears upon mouse click is very informative. But like the Google API with KML format the symbology is a bit confusing.
